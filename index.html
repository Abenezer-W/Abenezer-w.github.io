    <p>I go by abe most of the time if thats easier. I am a software engineer who  currently works on android apps for smart Tv's. I went to school at the University of denver and have a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science</p>
    <p>I am interested in Systems programming as it pertains to low latency systems in servers, ML and embedded environment. Although I am not the most knowledgeable about systems programming I would like to get better and this blog is a way I track my learning.
